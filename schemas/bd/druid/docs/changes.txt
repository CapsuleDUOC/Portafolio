=== Version 3.13 on 01-Jun-2012
=============================================================================

- Sql generation modules: added possibility to specify alternate drop table
  and drop sequence statements

- DDF:
	- Incremented version to 3. Now, timestamps are read/written in UTC timezone.
	  Version 1 and 2 are still read using the default timezone.

- Bugs fixed:
	- Sql generation: DROP sequences statements got generated even though the
	  "generate sequence" flag was unchecked.

- Changes:
	- For Oracle DBMSs, the DATE type is converted into a timestamp
	- Improved JDBC's metadata retrieval (this allows to get metadata from Vertica DB)
	- Added a template for MySQL 5 databases.

- New PHP code generation features (added by Paul J. Morris):
	- Addition of substantial new code generation capabilities for PHP. This has been under
	  development for some years and about the time of the release of druid 3.9 underwent
	  refactoring to split out the database specific code into a set of decorator classes.
	  The refactoring is not complete.  The code mostly works, but issues remain and more
	  updating, refactoring, and testing are needed, in particular the generated code has
	  not been tested with newer versions of dojo, the mysql decorator hasn't been fully
	  refactored (the mysqli decorator is used instead), and some data model constructs
	  (e.g. field names that are PHP reserved words, entities with a pair of primary keys
	  and no other attributes) don't produce valid PHP code. The PHP code generation can,
	  depending on the user's selections, span the range from the original light weight
	  proxy object classes to an almost complete database driven web site with classes that
	  support CRUD and use an extendable model-view-controller framework (where model and
	  views are generated, including views providing JSON support for picklists and ajax
	  editing using (an older version of) the dojo framework. The functionality is documented
	  in a php_code_generation addition to the manuals directory.
	- Added support for full text indexes - primarily the MySQL feature, with picklists and
	  sql generation in core druid.  Added a druid.core.DataLib.isIndexed() method to allow
	  detection of indexed fields from code generation modules.  Added additional MySQL database
	  types (merge, memmory, csv, blackhole, etc).  Added druid.core.DataLib.isUnsigned() method
	  to allow detection of unsigned integer data types.  Added Change and Done buttons to
	  DataTypeSelector dialog, allowing dialog to be closed from the Done button.
	- Added a getkeySelectDistinctJSONFilteredMethod to the PHP code generation 
	  to allow generation of a backing method to work with current dojo (1.6.1) 
	  FilteringSelect controls. Implemented and tested in mysqli decorator, implemented 
	  but didn't test in oracle and postgres decorators.  Added only a stub in dbo and 
	  mysql decorators.
	- Fixed PHP code generation for MySQLi to allow for the construction of valid PHP class 
	  files for all table structures found in the Specify Software Project's Specify6 schema 
	  (and the generated code passes all unit tests). Generated code is now valid PHP for 
	  classes built from associative entities that lack a single auto-incrementing primary 
	  key, and valid when a prefix or suffix is specified in the UI (the prefix being applied
	  to the class file names, but not to the database table names).  Similar changes are 
	  needed for the other PHP decorators.

=== Version 3.12 on 13-May-2011
=============================================================================

- DDF
	- designed a new format to handle both insert, update and delete of records
	- DDF code has been put into a separate selfcontained jar (LGPL license) to
	  allow reuse outside of Druid

- JDBC
	- Added header (list of query fields) to CSV export
	- SQL Navigator
		- max rows has now a default value of 100, is never disabled, max value is now 50000
		- Added explain plan functionality for Oracle
	- Table data editor
		- max rows has now a default value of 100, is never disabled, max value is now 50000

- MySQLModule
	- Added a table's flag to specify the AUTO_INCREMENT option for primary keys

- OracleModule
	- Added a table's flag to automatically generate a sequence for primary keys
	- Added possibility to specify an alternate drop table statement

=============================================================================
=== Version 3.11 on 06-Nov-2010
=============================================================================

- Added DROP VIEW IF EXISTS to MySql generation module

- Added "Table references" summary module to generate, for each table, all
  tables with fkeys to this one.

- ER-VIEW
	- Added confirmation dialog when removing views, entities and er-colors
	- Added referencing tables to entity's tooltip
	- Added menuitem to add all tables referencing a given entity as separate entities
	- Fixed bug in the treeview: the cut & delete operations where inverted if
	  selected from the drop down menu
	- Fixed bug in the treeview: the paste operation did not remap the color-id
	- Improved look
		- separated fkeys from field list
		- attributes are now optional
		- text and title backgrounds are now optional
	- Added possibilities to add colors from a color set (theme)
	- Added possibility to import entities singularly

- Code and PDF generation: now a relative path provided in the output panel is considered
  relative to the project's path.

- Added "ghost tables": these tables represents external tables that should not be included
  in the generated SQL

- JDBC
	- now the table's data panel remembers the "where" string when the table is selected again

- Bugs fixed:
	- 2974538 : wrong paragraph indexing in PDF generation (thanks to cboudy)
	- 2930229 : Postgres SQL generation: bigserial was not converted to bigint (thanks to Jaret Ward)
	- 2705237 : PHP code generation: Removed closing tag (thanks to Bernie Schelberg)

=============================================================================
=== Version 3.10 on 20-Sep-2009
=============================================================================

- Improved DDF module
   - Import : In case of errors, a dialog pops up asking for an action (retry,
     skip, skip all, abort)
   - Added import and export of boolean datatypes
   - Added progress bar both when importing and exporting

- Added patch to fix a bug with MySQL JDBC connections. In case of errors, Druid
  had to be restarted. Thanks to Paul J. Morris.

- Sql diff: fixed fieldAttrib lookup that caused problems with indexes
